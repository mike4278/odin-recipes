    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Fried chicken with cheese and marinara on a sub.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
      <li>4 frozen chicken breast fillets</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Garlic bread</li>
      <li>1 cup of tomato or marinara sauce</li>
      <li>4 slices of provolone cheese</li>
      <li>12 fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>aluminum foil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a baking pan
        with vegetable oil spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place frozen chicken fillets on the prepared pan and bake for 10 to 12
        minutes. Turn chicken, sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese on each
        fillet, and bake until crispy, an additional 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice garlic bread into 4 equal portions. Open each portion and place
        garlic side up on a baking sheet. Warm garlic bread in the oven about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the sandwiches, place a chicken fillet on a piece of garlic
        bread, spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce on top of the
        chicken, and lay a slice of provolone on top of the sauce. Place 3 basil
        leaves, or more to taste, on each sandwich, and top with the other half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap each sandwich in foil and return to the oven until the cheese is
        melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Unwrap and serve warm.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>
      Use the same pan for all three steps to save yourself some cleanup. When
      the chicken comes out of the oven, place on a plate and use the same pan
      to warm the bread, and then to warm the completed sandwiches.
